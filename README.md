# Dynamic-Programming-and-Computational
Computational/numerical methods and some dynamic programming techniques include VFI, OPI, HPI, and more! 

See each assignment for the task, and see the corresponding Jupyter Notebook for the solutions. 

Assignment 1 includes Value function iteration (VFI) and Optimistic policy iteration (OPI) in a saving model using Julia.

Assignment 2 includes some ergodicity exercises, I conduct them using Python with JIT. 

Assignment 3 is a nonlinear asset pricing model, I did it using a GPU and JAX to speed it up in Python. 

Assignment 4 has a Model of Inventory Management with State-Dependent Discounting. I solve the model using VFI, OPI, and HPI, trying to minimize
execution time using Python with JAX.
